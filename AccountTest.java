/*Write a java program in which you are required to define a class named Account. The
class must include the following two data members.
// data member for account holderâ€™s name
1: accountHolder
//data member for amount in the account
2: amount
Your Program should define three constructors for the class Account
1: a constructor with no parameter
2: a constructor with two parameters (accountHolder, amount) 
3: a copy constructor
All of these three constructors are meant to initialize their respective objects. Incase
of copy constructor, you are required to assign a separate space for the data
members of the new object while copying the values of previously existed object.
Declare three objects (1 for each type of constructor) in main.
Write a function in class Account to display the initialized data members for each
object.
Also count and display the total count of objects in the start and end of main.
